title: Authentication
---

The Onboarding APIs use the **BaaSAuthorizer** for authorization, which is a simple and secure method to authenticate API requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This method ensures that only authorized clients can access the API endpoints.

## **Overview**
- **Authorization Header**: JWT tokens are included in the HTTP request header.
- **Scheme**: Bearer token.
- **Purpose**: Validates the caller's credentials to grant access to API resources.

## Example Request

```json
curl -L 'https://api.sandbox.developer.btgpactual.com/ob/kyc/check/1ac938d0-fced-45be-9a91-084be913c1c9' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```
